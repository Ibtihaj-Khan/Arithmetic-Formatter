This is my Arithmetic Formatter program, done as part of the Free Code Camp "Scientific Computing With Python" curriculum.

It is basically a function that takes in:
    -List of Arithmetic Operations (ex. ["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"])
    -Boolean to print answers (T/F)

The project constrains only support up to 5 list items, numbers up to 4 digits each, and only addition/subtraction as operators.

The main challenge here was figuring out how to choose how to arrange the data structures in such a way to create the output with the correct spacings expected by the tests.
